        <h4>
            Hi, I'm Sangeetha, a web development enthusiast with a background in Physics and a passion for technology.
            With my Master's in Computer Applications (MCA), I am starting my journey in web development and learning the
            basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            My goal is to build user-friendly and responsive websites while growing my skills step by step.
            I believe that continuous learning and curiosity are key to success in any field.
            Beyond coding, I enjoy listening to music, watching films, and cycling.
            I also have a keen interest in exploring astrophysics and solving puzzles.
            I am excited to grow as a developer and contribute to meaningful projects in the future.
